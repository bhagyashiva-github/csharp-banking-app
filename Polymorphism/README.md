# Polymorphism in C#

## Overview
This C# program simulates investment banking using **polymorphism**. It calculates expected returns for different types of investments.

## Features
- Implements **polymorphism** with a base `Investment` class and derived classes (`StockInvestment`, `BondInvestment`, `RealEstateInvestment`).
- Uses **NLog** for logging transactions.
- Includes **exception handling** to catch errors gracefully.

## Sample Output 
Investment: Tech Stocks, Amount: $10,000.00
Expected Returns: $1,200.00

Investment: Government Bonds, Amount: $5,000.00
Expected Returns: $250.00

Investment: Commercial Property, Amount: $20,000.00
Expected Returns: $1,600.00
